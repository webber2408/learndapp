Who would have known that a transaction made 13 yrs ago would have the potential to shape the entire future! Well, 13 yrs ago, Satoshi Nakamoto sent Hal Finney 10 bitcoins in bitcoin's first transaction ever.

According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp), A **blockchain** is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network.

Let us break it down, a **distributed database** is just something that involves multiple database servers located physically at different locations storing the entire range of data _distributed_ amongst them. By definition of blockchain, we can as of now infer that there is a network of computers that is storing _some_ data in a distributed manner!

Let's keep it simple for now and we will improve our definition as we progress through this blog series.

Moving ahead, we also used the term, _transaction_. But before that, let us understand what Peer-to-Peer means.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

A peer-to-peer network is a group of computers that are linked together and can share data/messages between them.

A **transaction** between any such two computers contains a P2P message along with other metadata including sender and receiver information, timestamps, etc.

How does the blockchain store data, and what does it consist of? We will be visiting these questions briefly in the upcoming sections, precisely in Blockchain Architecture.

So what are we taking away?

_We now know that Blockchain is some sort of a database that stores the data in a distributed manner using **blocks**! (curious? We are going to discuss it next!) amongst a peer-to-peer network!_
