Hi,

Hope everything is going great with you.

I recently got a chance to dive into the field of **Blockchain** and it has left me amazed! I am stunned by the revolutionary ideas and underlying technology it has.

I am writing this (long) article (more of a course?) explaining what is Blockchain and how you can as a developer dive into this field and contribute.

Nowadays, there are a ton of resources available to learn Blockchain but since this technology is gaining so much hype, it gets really challenging to stay up to date and find a resource that is latest and explains everything in detail. (All at one place).

With this course, I will be explaining every concept that one needs to learn to build his own Blockchain Application with the entire knowledge about its working and of the chain as well.

Below will be the course structure:

> 1. What is Blockchain?
> 2. Why do we need Blockchain?
> 3. How does Blockchain work? Blockchain Architecture.
> 4. Understanding Smart Contracts.
> 5. Diving into Solidity.
> 6. Solidity - Syntax Overview & Remix (Writing first Smart Contract!)
> 7. Designing a Smart Contract & Capstone Project - (OpinonFlow) Overview
> 8. Capstone Project - Designing & writing the solidity code.
> 9. Understanding Web3
> 10. Exploring Truffle - Setting up base for the capstone project.
> 11. Diving into Building - OpinionFlow DAPP - Using React.JS & Web3.
> 12. Exploring FT (Fungible Tokens) ERC20 Standard.
> 13. Exploring NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) ERC721 Standard.
> 14. Integrating OpinionFlow with ERC20.
> 15. Understanding Solidity Testing.
> 16. Under the Hood: Cryptography & Hashing.
> 17. Deploying & Testing (Capstone Project - OpinionFlow) DAPP.
> 18. Graduation!

I have worked for months to create this course and the best way to get the most out of it is to follow along, slowly and steadily! There is no rush, focus on understanding the concepts.

:::

As far as the prerequisite is considered, I would expect any reader to have a basic understanding of Programming (Any Language) and some knowledge of JavaScript (As we will be dealing with Web3).

Obviously, I will be talking also in terms of React / HTML / CSS / JSX, etc. but these can be skipped and you can obviously skip the complex UI part of the DAPP and create your minimal one. Moreover, I will also be explaining any new concepts in these fields, if need be.

_I hope and wish you like this course content._

**_Happy Learning!_**
